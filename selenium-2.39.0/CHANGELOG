v2.39.0
=======
WebDriver:
 * Update to support native events for Firefox 26.
 * Removed server side of iPhone driver.
 * Removed server-side of AndroidDriver and deprecating client side.

WebDriverJS:
 * FIXED: 6686: Changed Deferred#cancel() to silently no-op if the
   deferred has already been resolved.

v2.38.0
=======
WebDriver:
  * Update to support native events for Firefox 25.
  * Updated httpclient and httpcore maven dependencies
  * When moving the mouse relative to an element hidden in a parent's
    overflow region, that element must first be scrolled into view
    before the mouse move can be completed.
  * Removed WindowsProxyManager from InternetExplorerDriver, proxy
    management is implemented in IEDriverServer now.
  * The logging level for the FirefoxDriver's native components can now
    be set from the command line with the SELENIUM_LOG_LEVEL
    environment variable. Valid values are ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG,
    and TRACE. If the value is not set, or an unrecognized value is
    specified, the log level will be set to FATAL (which was the
    previous behavior).
  * Implemented ability to return Date object from executeScript
    (Firefox only).
  * Fixed Firefox returning the actual state of nativeEvents.
  * Made it possible to switch the webdriver.xpi from the command line
    using a system property.
  * Removed hardcoded chromedriver version
  * SafariDriver WebElement#getTagName() should return a lowercase
    string.
  * If ChromeDriver fails to start, suppress any exceptions from the
    subsequent "clean-up" quit() so the error from start is not lost.
  * Added an alternate, and Android-friendly, implementation of the
    Augmenter that uses JDK interface proxies instead of cglib. This
    new implementation is available as org.openqa.remote.JdkAugmenter;
    the default Augmenter implementation still relies on cglib.
  * Prevented an infinite loop when computing overflow state when the
    documentElement has fixed position.
  * Improveed logging for UnixProcess#destroy().
  * If an error is thrown while typing a key sequence, return that
    error to the client. Prior to this change, the driver would
    effectively hang.
  * Do not attempt to generate a key event if the target element is no
    longer attached to the DOM. nsIPressShell (which is used to
    dispatch events) will throw a generic NS_UNEXPECTED_ERROR if we
    fail to make this check.
  * FIXED: 3107: (On behalf of Ross Patterson) Preventing possible NPE.
  * FIXED: 4501: (On behalf of Robert Ambrus) Introduced a system
    property org.openqa.jetty.SocketListener.bufferSize that allows to
    set the size of the buffer Jetty uses for network communications.
  * FIXED: 4698: Added missing expected conditions.
  * FIXED: 5295: User defined element properties should be retrievable
    with getAttribute.
  * FIXED: 5900: Revamped the SafariDriver's internal networking.
  * FIXED: 6294: Implemented ability to switch to a frame by id or name
    in WDBS.
  * FIXED: 6358: Disabled Content Security Policy in Firefox.
  * FIXED: 6414: Fixed the way EventFiringWebDriver unwraps the
    underlying driver.
  * FIXED: 6431: Catch an exception thrown if the chrome executable is
    not found and stop chromedriver before propagating it.
  * FIXED: 6445: Shortened Firefox profile textual representation in
    capabilities.
  * FIXED: 6473: Implemented ability to pass --verbose option to
    chromedriver.

WebDriver JS:
  * Always annotate errors for rejected promises
  * FIXED: 6284: Omit x/y offsets from the mouseMove command instead of
    defaulting to (0,0).
  * FIXED: 6471: Correctly document the contract on
    WebElement#getAttribute
  * FIXED: 6612: On Unix, use the default IANA ephemeral port range if
    unable to retrieve the current system's range.
  * FIXED: 6617: Checking for Error.captureStackTrace is sufficient to
    determine if an environment supports stack traces. This avoids
    unnecessarily triggering debuggers configured to halt when an error
    is thrown.
  * FIXED: 6627: Safely rebuild chrome.Options from a partial JSON spec.

Grid:
  * FIXED: 6357: Added PhantomJS icon to the grid console.
  * FIXED: 6392: Removed misleading log messages.

RC:
  * FIXED: 1666: Fixed typo in RegExp.test function name.
  * FIXED: 1758: Ignoring closed windows when collecting attributes
    from all windows (RC).
  * FIXED: 2508: Fixed screenshot size calculation for quirks mode (RC)
  * FIXED: 2845: Moved storedVars from test case level to test suite
    level.
  * FIXED: 3185: Fixed JSON converter (RC).
  * FIXED: 3270: Fixed switch to window by var= locator (RC).
  * FIXED: 5103: Fixed screenshooter in Firefox and Selenium RC,
    limiting the size of the screenshot to pevent failures.
  * FIXED: 6496: Enabled .htm and .xhtml extensions for test suites.

v2.37.0
=======
  * Fix Firefox native event support on Linux for 23 & 24.

v2.36.0
=======
WebDriver:
  * Updated Firefox native event components to support Firefox 24.
  * Updated HtmlUnit to 2.13.
  * Updated HttpClient to 4.3.
  * Updated version of Guava to 15.
  * Updated version of wgxpath.
  * Return an empty string instead of "null" when the browserName and
    version capabilities are not set.
  * Stop propagation of the webdriver-evaluate custom event when
    executing user supplied JavaScript. Without this change, the event
    handler will trigger twice for async scripts, causing the driver to
    attempt to evaluate the user script twice, leading to unpredictable
    behavior.
  * Added a new pause action to the interactions API.
  * Improved support for using the HTML5 APIs through the remote
    server by augmenting the session driver before attempting to
    access HTML5 capabilities.  If the driver does not support the
    requested feature, throw an UnsupportedCommandException instead of
    a ClassCastException.
  * Implemented elementScrollBehavior capability in FirefoxDriver.
  * Fixed getLocation to work on scrolled pages.
  * Fixed autoscrolling for elements located in frames.
  * Fixed drag-n-drop for elements in frames in Firefox with native
    events
  * Implemented SOCKS proxy support for FirefoxDriver
  * Fixed support for SVG documents in the atoms.
  * Fixed computing an element's container dimensions to account for
    the scrollbar size when scrolling
  * FIXED: 2670: Made subclasses of By serializable.
  * FIXED: 6200: Pass command line arguments to the Selenium server
    instead of to the JVM.
  * FIXED: 6293: Added more informative error message.
  * FIXED: 6346: Allow args to passed to the JVM using the jvmArgs
    option.

Grid:
  * Added ability to fetch slotCounts from /grid/api/hub. The resource
    looks like this:
    
        { "slotCounts": { "total": 20, "free": 8 } }

  * Added ability to fetch newSessionRequestCount from the
    /grid/api/hub resource.


v2.35.0
=======
WebDriver:
  * Updated Firefox native event components to support Firefox 23.
  * Removing deprecated interactions interfaces (Keyboard, Mouse,
    TouchScreen).
  * Updated operadriver to 1.4.
  * Introduced ie.setProxyByServer capability to select how IE browser
    proxy will be set up, either by old Java code using Windows
    registry or inside IEDriverServer using WinINet methods. This
    capability is marked as deprecated and will be removed in future
    versions. In the future, IE proxy settings will be set up only by
    IEDriverServer. Current default value of ie.setProxyByServer is
    false so Windows registry will be used for IE proxy setup.
  * Guarded around IE returning an empty object for the active element.
  * FIXED: 6055: Fixing "invalid xpath" issue, actually invalid NS
    resolver.

WebDriver JS:
  * FIXED: 6079: The parent process should not wait for spawned driver
    service processes (chromedriver, phantomjs, etc.)

v2.34.0
=======

WebDriver:
  * Updated Firefox native event components to support Firefox 22.
  * Update synthesized mouse implementation. Mouse moves are
    implemented using nsIDOMWindowUtils.
  * Finding libX11.so.6 in a slightly more intelligent way: Check that
    dlopen actually succeeds, if not found in one of the fixed paths,
    look in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
  * Added ExpectedConditions to check for the visibility of all
    WebElements in a List
  * Updated the wgxpath library.
  * Updated our copy of the Closure compiler and library to the most
    recent versions.
  * Updated the atoms library, including support for MS pointer events
    and refinements to element visibility tests.
  * Close all open connections when stopping the SafariDriver server.
  * Fall back to a loopback address if the current machine does not
    have an external IP address (as will be the case when there is no
    internet connection).
  * Remove sizzle dependency from the firefox driver. We only needed
    this for versions of firefox prior to 3.5, which we no longer
    support.
  * Fixed Select.escapeQuotes method.
  * Added SafariOptions and support for custom Safari extensions.
  * Moved Mouse, Keyboard and TouchScreen to the interactions package
    where they belong. This has the benefit of also making our build
    files simpler once we delete the original versions which have been
    deprecated.
  * Deprecated the HasTouchScreen interface.
  * Fixed condition in Select.select_by_index method to fix case when
    selection is performed by index on a multiple select element.
  * Implemented an alpha version of a Marionette (WebDriver implemented
    natively in Firefox) driver.
  * Deprecated IPhoneDriver.
  * Added support for the HTML5 "hidden" attribute. If an element, or
    ancestor, has hidden attribute make, it is not shown.
  * FIXED: 2285: Allow setting default logLevel for standalone-server.
  * FIXED: 5609: Adding the ability to redirect firefox process output
    to file.
  * FIXED: 5669: Add Driver#remote_status for the Ruby remote driver.
  * FIXED: 5715: Adding toString method for the event firing
    webelement.

WebDriver JS:
  * When capturing console output, guard against user scripts that 
    redefine the console global.
  * Improved logging in the test client.
  * Use goog.labs.testing.assertThat for the assertThat library.
  * Improved stack trace handling
  * Defined a webdriver.Capabilities class for webdriverjs.
  * Added native ChromeDriver support to WebDriverJs.
  * Mark discarded tasks as cancelled to prevent hanging on
    asynchronously scheduled callbacks.
  * Include the webdriverjs tests in the built npm package. Updated
    the README with instructions for running the tests using npm.
  * Add native PhantomJS support to webdriverjs.

Grid:
  * Update grid for change in behavior of WebDriver's new session
    command.
  * Fixed handling of JSON conversion errors at node.
  * FIXED: 5942: Fix hang of hub when node machine is not available.

RC:
  * Fixed RC tests failing in Firefox beta builds. This has been fixed
    in two ways:

    * Rely on the automation atoms where possible.
    * Obtain the document and window from the element the event is
      firing from.

    In the course of fixing this, all but one usage of "triggerEvent"
    was replaced. Because of this, the method has been inlined to the last
    call site.
  * FIXED: 1646: UTF-8 encoded user-extensions.js support.


v2.33.0
=======

WebDriver:
  * getText() ignores elements in the <head>
  * Bundled OperaDriver version bumped to 1.3.
  * Added a FindAll annotation for the PageFactory to use.
  * Added a toString() implementation to Color.
  * Deleted the Selenium-backed WebDriver.
  * FIXED: 2218: IE >=9 versions triggerMouseEvent like other
    browsers.
  * FIXED: 2610: Implementing ability to specify path to the chrome
    executable in the node configuration file using chrome_binary
    capability.
  * FIXED: 2685: Increasing port range for Firefox to chose from when
    starting.
  * FIXED: 4790: Improvements made to Firefox startup in highly
    concurrent environments.
  * FIXED: 5045: Added support for fetching logs from SafariDriver.
  * FIXED: 5652: Adding unhandled alert text to the exception message.
  * Added LogType.PERFORMANCE, supported in chromedriver2 0.9+.

WebDriver JS:
  * FIXED: 5511: Implement
    driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms) for WebDriverJs.
  * FIXED: 5632: It's now possible to create a new session with
    WebDriverJs when running in a browser.
  * Add a WebDriverJs client to the SafariDriver's logging window so
    it's possible to use WebDriver from the devtools REPL on that
    page.

Grid:

  * Making "beta" console the default one, it's time to get out of
    beta status
  * Old console is now available at /grid/old/console/
  * Addressed memory leaks caused by per-session logging.
  * FIXED: 3001: Making Selenium the default protocol if a node was
    started with "-role rc" option.
  
RC:
  * FIXED: 3636: selenium.fireEvent works with the webdriver-backed
     selenium and IE.
  
v2.32.0
=======

WebDriver:
  This release supports Firefox verions: 10esr, 17esr, 19, 20

  * Let WindowsUtils.killPID() kill the whole process tree
  * Implementing support for implicit "submit" button type in
    HtmlUnitDriver.
  * bug fix for python hang with 302 response
  * Adding better support for SVG within Firefox. Has better scrolling
    to element and allows JavaScript execution
  * Fixing case of "no active element" for HtmlUnitDriver
  * WindowsUtils.kill() fix on Windows 8
  * Updating HtmlUnit to 2.12 (and cssparser to 0.9.9)
  * Fixing illegal negative timeout values for HtmlUnitDriver, zero
    means infinite wait
  * Implementing pageLoadTimeout in HtmlUnitDriver
  * Allow users to specify a custom location for Safari's data
    directory using the "safari.dataDir" capability.
  * Fix for using DesiredCapabilities with WebDriverBackedSelenium
  * PhantomJS Driver bindings updated to 1.0.3
  * Minimize the number of third party libraries used by the very
    heart of the remote webdriver server.
  * fix issue where server was appending '?null' to all forwarded
    requests
  * Issues fixed: 5293, 4902, 5283, 5278

v2.31.0
=======
  (summary not created, check version history logs)

v2.30.0
=======

WebDriver:
  * Fixing a bug introduced by a change in how we get already logged
    messages from the console service in firefox. This allows us to
    function with firefox 19
  * FIXED: 1181: Improved loopback detection
  * FIXED: 1627: Implementing ability to use auto proxy in
    HtmlUnitDriver.
  * FIXED: 3652: moveToElement with offset should consider 0 as a
    valid value, not as "undefined".
  * FIXED: 3868: Better ephemeral port range selection.
  * FIXED: 4107: Added prebuilt version of the SafariDriver extension
    to the client jar.
  * FIXED: 4821: WebDriverBackedSelenium works when added to project
    via maven.
  * FIXED: 4940, 5075: Added iceweasel to list of firefox variants.
  * FIXED: 5022: Text node with overflow:hidden and height/width 0 to
    not be visible since we cant see them.
  * FIXED: 5030: Only send files to upload, not directories.
  * FIXED: 5079: FluentWait.until(Predicate) method does not propagate
    predicate message.
  * FIXED: 5109: We should show elements visible if there is a pixel
    visible.
  * Semi-private change: Changes in the Coordinate class.

JS:
  * Update WebDriverJS to support parallel flows.  This change renames
   several low-level classes and functions in the promise module:
    
      promise.Application                                 -> promise.ControlFlow
        #schedule(string, function)                       ->   #execute(function, [string])
        #scheduleTimeout(string, number)                  ->   #timeout(number, [string])
        #scheduleWait(string, function, number, [string]) ->   #wait(function, number, [string])
   
    The old schedule* functions are still present, but will print a
    warning message if called. They will be removed in 2.31.

RC:
  * Added ability to use relative path to an -htmlSuite file.
  * FIXED: 3498: Proxy based browsers are back to normal on HTTPS
  * FIXED: 5113: Implementing GET requests support for RC protocol.


v2.29.0
=======

WebDriver:
  * Firefox 18 support.
  * IEDriver supports "requireWindowFocus" desired capability. When
    using this and native events, the IE driver will demand focus and
    user interactions will use SendInput() for simulating user
    interactions. Note that this will mean you MUST NOT use the
    machine running IE for anything else as the tests are running.
  * Use the "webdriver.remote.shorten_log_messages" system property to
    reduce the verboseness of ouput from executeScript and
    executeAsyncScript when using the RemoteWebDriver.
  * Switching HtmlUnitDriver default from FIREFOX_3_6 to FIREFOX_10
  * SafariDriverExtension should restore Safari's previous settings on
    shutdown.
  * Bundled version of PhantomJSDriver bumped to 1.0.1
  * Updated the version of guava-libraries used to 14.
  * Updated HtmlUnit to 2.11
  * Deprecated XPathLookupException in favour of
    InvalidSelectorException
  * FIXED: 3602: Changing IE view port calculations to allow for
    always-present vertical scroll bar, and to test for horizontal
    scroll bar and adjust as required by page content.
  * FIXED: 4576: self registering proxy now check for user specified
    proxy id.
  * FIXED: 5010: icons in chrome newtab now correctly identified as
    being shown.

RC:
  * FIXED: 4818: Make sure that each generated SSL cert has a unique
    ID associated with it.

Project:
  * Moved to git. Most obvious in revision number in our exceptions.


v2.28.0
=======

WebDriver:
  * "null" can now be passed to executeScript
  * .Net: Corrected FileUtilities.FindFile() to correctly return the
    current directory if the specified file is located there.
  * .Net: Introduces the Updating the CustomFinderType property to the
    .NET FindsByAttribute. This allows use of custom By subclasses in
    the PageFactory. The custom finder must be a subclass of By, and
    it must expose a public constructor that takes a string argument.
  * SafariDriver: better attempts to catch native dialogs from user
    defined onbeforeunload handlers.
  * Updating HtmlUnit to 2.11
  * Added the PhantomJS bindings to the release. You'll still need to
    download PhantomJS itself separately.

RC:
  * Implemented getAllWindowNames in WebDriverBackedSelenium
  * Implemented openWindow in WebDriverBackedSelenium to allow opening
    relative URLs


v2.27.0
=======

WebDriver:
  * Added support for native events for Firefox 17. 
  * Added support for ghostdriver (PhantomJS)
  * Adding new capability "enableElementCacheCleanup" to the IE
    driver. When set to true, the IE driver will clean the
    known-element cache of invalid elements after every page
    load. This is intended to keep memory usage down and improve
    performance. However, it is an intrusive change, so this
    capability is provided temporarily to allow disabling this
    behavior if problems arise. The default of this new capability is
    "true", meaning this behavior is turned on by default.
  * Added shift key handling to the synthetic keyboard actions.
  * Modifying scroll behavior in IE driver SendKeysCommandHandler to
    call Element::GetLocationOnceScrolledIntoView() instead of calling
    the DOM scrollIntoView() function. Should result in less page
    scrolling during test runs.
  * Checking if CSS transforms on elements, or their parents, are
    hiding them and therefore returning they arent visible.
  * Add not, refreshed, invisibilityOfElementWithText to
    ExpectedConditions.
  * Added support for new IE10 pointer events.
  * FIXED: 1543: Allowing equal sign in a cookie value.
  * FIXED: 2103, 3508: Modified to no longer hang on alerts triggered
    by onchange of <select> elements or by onsubmit of <form>
    elements.
  * FIXED: 2035: Returning a simple result (null) after opening a new
    window instead of the window object (that can't be serialized to
    JSON).
  * FIXED: 2353: Only call blur() for IE if the element is not the
    <body> element.
  * FIXED: 3043: Better error message reporting when browser launch
    fails.
  * FIXED: 4490: Checking script evaluation result to prevent null
    reference exception.
  * FIXED: 4736: Added all of the extended colour keywords to the
    Colors enum in support of
    http://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3/Color/Extended_color_keywords.
  * FIXED: 4800: Fixed calculation of coordinates for elements in
    frames/iframes where the element is scrolled out of view within
    the frame.

Grid:
  * FIXED: 3818: Generating session identifiers with UUID to prevent duplication.

RC:
  * FIXED: 4668: Fixing ability to open relative URLs in WDBS.
  * FIXED: 4273: Added getCssCount to the list of the methods
    supported by WebDriverBackedSelenium.
  * FIXED: 4055: WDBS implementation of getValue for radio buttons now
    reflects behaviour of RC.
  * FIXED: 4784: Processing locators before use in getCssCount and
    getXpathCount.


v2.26.0
=======
WebDriver:
  * Updated OperaDriver to 0.15.
  * Added transparency support to the Color class.
  * Increased lock time a bit for the FirefoxDriver to make tests more 
    stable on Windows.
  * Added the enablePersistenHover capability to allow the user to specify
    whether to use the persistent hover thread in the IE driver. Defaults
	to true for IE.
  * Added support for native events for Firefox 15 and 16.
  * Removed deprecation from ChromeDriver constructors that take a Capabilities
    object. Also added a method to set experimental options in ChromeOptions
	which may be used to set options that aren't exposed through the ChromeOptions
    API.
  * Fixed SafariDriver to allow calling .quit() consecutively without error.
  * Modified FirefoxDriver to use atoms to switch between frames.
  * FIXED: 4535: Hover still does not work perfectly in IE.
  * FIXED: 4676: Unable to fire javascript events into SVG's. 
  * FIXED: 4320: Impossible to IE run tests in parallel via TestNG.
  * FIXED: 4309: 'Could not convert Native argument arg 0' error with Firefox.
  * FIXED: 4593: Alert.accept() Cancels the Resend Alert/Dialog Box.
  * FIXED: 4321: Upgrade HtmlUnitDriver to HtmlUnit 2.10.
  * FIXED: 4639: Webdriver 2.25 fails to quit on Windows.
  * FIXED: 3774: New SafariDriver sessions do not come with a clean profile.
  * FIXED: 4375: Executing javascript hangs Firefox.
  * FIXED: 4203: Java SafariDriver has limited websocket frame size.
  * FIXED: 4165: WebDriver fails on a machine with no IP address.
  * FIXED: 3969: SafariDriver should auto-dismiss alerts.

WebDriverJS:
  * FIXED: 4648: findElement errros not helpful.
  * FIXED: 4687: webserverjs cannot find module in node.js.
  * FIXED: 4649: Wrong Content-Length calculation in webdriverjs.
  * FIXED: 4425: Webdriver.js regression: webdriver.By.* selectors defect when
    using Node.js.

Grid:
  * FIXED: 4433: NPE at grid launch if invalid servlet class name is specified.
  * FIXED: 4526: elenium node stop responding when there are 2 or more tests
    waiting for a specific node.
  * FIXED: 2549: "-role hub" doesn't allow Firefox to starts.

v2.25.0
=======
WebDriver:
  * Added API for dealing with BASIC and DIGEST authentication
    dialogs. Currently not implemented in any drivers.
  * Warn users that the IE driver will no longer use the DLL in the
    next release.
  * Deprecated browser specific WebElement subclasses.
  * Added support for "requiredCapabilities" to the remote webdrivers
    and implemented basic support for these in the firefox
    driver. Failure to fulfull a required capability will cause a
    SessionNotCreatedException to be thrown.
  * Added the ability to determine how unhandled alerts should be
    handled. This is handled by the "unexpectedAlertBehaviour"
    capability, which can be one of "accept", "dismiss" or
    "ignore". Java code should use the UnexpectedAlertBehaviour
    enum. This is only implemented in Firefox for now.
  * Allow native events to be configured in Firefox and
    (experimentally) in IE using the "nativeEvents" capability.
  * Updated supported versions of Firefox to 17.
  * Firefox driver will enumerate through client rects until finding
    one with non-zero dimensions when clicking.
  * Better support for hovering on linux.
  * Safari driver will dismiss open alerts to prevent tests from
    hanging.
  * Better handling of overflow edge cases when determining element
    visibility.
  * Point users in the right direction when Safari fails to load a
    file:// URL.
  * Allowed to use IEDriverServer logging abilities in Java binding.
  * Avoid an issue where a call to submit could hang the firefox
    driver.
  * FluentWait will now handle any Throwable, not just
    RuntimeExceptions.
  * FIXED: 3897: Allow windows to be resized from a frame.

WebDriverJS:
  * Better stack traces from test code.
  * Update webdriver.atoms.element.type to recognize
    webdriver.Key.SEPARATOR

RC:
  * Better emulation provided by the WebDriver-backed Selenium when
    using IE, particularly when emulating firing of events.

Grid:
  * FIXED: 3230: Implementing /lifecycle-manager?action=shutdown
    command for the Grid Hub to ensure backward compatibility with
    Grid1 behaviour.

Selenium Server:
  * Reworked SSL certificate generation code when proxying HTTPS
    connections to use non-deprecated APIs in BouncyCastle.

v2.24.1
=======
WebDriver:
  * Work has started on a basic performance profiler.
  * Java bindings: The Color class now supports more color conversions.
  * Failure to click on an element in the IE Driver will yield a more meaningful
    error.

    need the old behaviour.
  * Standardized colour values returned from getCssValue are
    normalized to RGBA.
  * IE can use synthesized events if the capability
    "enableNativeEvents" is set to false. This is experimental and not
    expected to work properly.
  * Native events added for Firefox 12. 
  * Native events retained for Firefox 10, 11, and 3.x
  * Selenium-backed WebDriver can now return WebElements from
    executeScript.

  * Issues 3328,3366
  * Improvements in thread dumps in both hub and node,
    possible to corrolate the two.

  * -browserTimeout <timeoutInSeconds> added to
    differentiate between browser hang and client gone (which is
    -timeout <timeout>)
    - System property -Dselenium.server.timeout removed, use -timeout instead.
    See http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/RemoteWebDriverServer 
    for further details.

    Fixing HTML dialog logic for self-closing documents.
    
    HTML dialog windows opened using showModalDialog() have no way to
    properly notify of their closing. The IE driver attempts to detect
    closing of these windows by listening for user-initiated actions,
    either by calling the WebDriver close method, or clicking on an
    element that causes the dialog to close. This commit adds logic to
    the method used for getting all window handles to validate the
    existence of any HTML dialog windows, properly notifying the driver
    if the OS-level window handle is no longer valid. Fixes issue #6249.

    Fixing HTML dialog logic for redirected documents.
    
    Getting the parent window of an HTML dialog's document can fail,
    especially if the document changed out from under us before we could get
    the window reference. The canonical case for this is a redirect using
    JavaScript. Now we will sleep for a shorttime, then retry to obtain the
    reference to the window object. Fixes issue #6224.

    Increasing IEDriverServer logging when waiting for navigation
    
    This commit adds more detailed logging while the driver is waiting for a
    page navigation to complete. It provides log lines for all of the cases
    where the driver would consider the navigation to be incomplete, in
    addition to logging the actual values for ready states when not found to
    be 'complete'.

    Adding ability to set additional ChromeOptions in the .NET bindings
    
    This allows the ability to set user profile preferences and local state
    preferences using the ChromeOptions class. The new
    AddUserProfilePreference and AddLocalStatePreference methods correspond to
    the "prefs" and "localState" capabilities documented in the chromedriver
    documentation. Note that the values passed in to these methods must be
    JSON-serializable, and no validation is done on these values at present.
    We now also allow setting the "detach" capability, which allows the user
    to specify that Chrome remain running after chromedriver.exe has quit.
    
    This commit also removes legacy code for the obsolete chrome.binary and
    chrome.switches capabilities, and changes the command line arguments to
    chromedriver.exe to include two hyphens, instead of one (e.g., "--silent"
    instead of "-silent").

    Introduce a mechanism for injecting a custom WebDriver provider into the
    Java test suite. This can be accomplished in one of two ways:
      - Using the -Dselenium.external.serverUrl system property to specfiy the
        URL of an external WebDriver server to run tests against. This server
        *must* conform to the JSON wire protocol.
    
      - Using the -Dselenium.external.supplierClass system property to
        specify the fully qualified name of a custom Supplier<WebDriver>
        implementation that can be found on the classpath. The designated class
        must have a public constructor that accepts two Capabilities objects
        as arguments for the desired and required capabilities, respectively.
    
    Sample usage:
    
    // Run the remote suite against an existing server:
    ./go test_remote jvmargs="-Dselenium.external.serverUrl=http://localhost:1234/wd/hub" log=true

    * support of bypass proxy hosts (noProxy) for HTTP and SOCKS proxies.
    * tests
    
    Now you could specify proxy settings using capabilities,
    Proxy object or directly calling methods for existed driver.
    
    Be note that bypass proxy hosts should be a string of hosts delimited by comma
    and each host needs to be Java regex pattern.

    Take document mode into account when getting size of view port of IE.
    
    When clicking elements in IE, we need to know if the element is in the
    view port, and this includes scroll bar calculations. However for sites
    that attempt to hide the vertical scroll bar in IE, this may result in
    different sizes based on the document rendering mode. Includes tests for
    clicking on a link at the very bottom of the view port.

    Refactored calculations to the size of the visible view port.
    
    There are circumstances where IE can have no vertical scroll bar. In
    these cases, the IE driver would assume there was a vertical scroll
    bar, which would make the actual width of the document larger than the
    computed width of the window. This, in turn, would make the driver
    assume there was a horizontal scroll bar, which would imply that
    absolutely-positioned elements at the bottom of the page would not be
    seen as clickable.

    This change makes two java changes to support running JS tests:
    - Restrict the window size when running JS tests as this matters for a lot
      of the overflow tests and not every browser supports window.resizeTo
    - When launching Opera, ensure geolocation is enabled by default

    Previously, you could only install extensions by using a path to a .crx

    having it persisted to the disk at all.

    Fixes Java porting error with Select.select_by_visible_text
    
    There was a Java to Python porting error.
    
    In Java if nothing was found by passed visible text all options
    with text equals to passed visible text.
    In Python if nothing was found by passed visible text all options
    _contains_ first nonempty part of passed visible text are selected.
    So in Python you could check options by word of visible text.
    In Java/C#/Ruby you could not do it.
    
    Also tests for this behaviour are removed.
    
    Fixes issue #3910.
